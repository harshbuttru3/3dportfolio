This folder should contain the following images:

1. grid.png - A subtle grid texture for the desktop background. You can create a simple grid pattern with thin lines on a transparent background for a cyberpunk effect.

You can either:
- Create your own grid pattern using a graphics editor
- Download free grid textures from websites like Unsplash, Freepik, or Pexels
- Use CSS to create the grid pattern instead of using an image

The grid should be subtle and not distract from the desktop content.
